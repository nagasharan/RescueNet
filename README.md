Identifying Damage levels in post Hazards scenario using semantic segmentation and machine learning


Natural hazards have threatened human civilization for centuries, causing significant loss of life and property. However, the magnitude of these losses is often exacerbated by delays in post-disaster response rather than the hazard itself. Machine learning and artificial intelligence advancements offer promising solutions to bridge this critical response gap. Among these, semantic segmentation, a powerful deep learning technique, is crucial in identifying damage levels caused by hurricanes. This study uses historical damage data from past hurricanes to train and evaluate four segmentation models: Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), DeepLabV3+, Segmenter, and Attention U-Net. Among them, Segmenter achieved the highest mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of (70.36\%), pixel accuracy (87.02\%), and PSPNet ranked second with the highest recorded values for precision (72.2\%), recall (62.2\%), and F1 score (64.5\%). This comparative analysis highlights the effectiveness of different architectures for disaster assessment and response planning, with PSPNet and Segmenter standing out as the most reliable models for fine-grained damage detection.
